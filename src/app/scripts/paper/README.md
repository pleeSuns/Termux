# paper.js notes

This `README.md` file contains notes about the trickier aspects of using the amazing `paper.js` library.
It also contains some implementation details specific to Shape Shifter that are important to remember.

## Coordinate spaces

One of the trickiest aspects of using the library is dealing with different coordinate spaces.

Consider a `paper.js` project with the following conditions:

* `<canvas style="width: 600px; height: 600px;" width="1200" height="1200">`

### Project coordinates

### Physical coordinates

### View coordinates

### Viewport coordinates

### Local coordinates

### Parent coordinates

## Tools

## TODOs

* Make sure "play animation" space keyboard shortcut plays nicely with zoom in/out tool
